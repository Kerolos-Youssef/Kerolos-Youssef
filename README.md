Aqarmap is a leading real estate app with over 200,000 listings, offering a platform to buy and sell properties across Egypt.

### 🔹 Betrader  
In this project, I created a network marketing application that seamlessly integrates e-commerce features and a loyalty points system. The application offers users the ability to register, log in, browse product categories, view items, make orders, and track their order status with ease. To enhance the project's code organization, readability, and maintainability, I applied clean architecture principles and adopted the MVVM design pattern. Moreover, I optimized the state management using Cubit and boosted performance through dependency injection.

### 🔹 CPS-HR  
This project was developed for [Continental Palace School](https://www.cps-education.com/) to streamline the management of teacher attendance, departures, early leave permissions, vacation requests, and tracking late arrivals. Users are provided credentials by the admin for accessing the application, restricted to a single device login unless authorized otherwise. Daily attendance and departure are recorded using generated barcodes. Employing clean architecture and the MVVM design pattern ensured superior code organization, readability, and maintainability. I further enhanced performance through optimized state management using Cubit and dependency injection techniques.
